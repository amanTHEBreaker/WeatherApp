## 🏗️ Architecture

This project strictly follows **Google’s official architecture guidance** for Android apps:

```
Presentation (UI) → ViewModel → Repository → Data Source
```

* **UI Layer** → Jetpack Compose + Material3
* **ViewModel Layer** → `StateFlow` for reactive state management
* **Data Layer** → Repository pattern to handle API/Local data
* **Dependency Injection** → Hilt (if added later)
